## Code of Conduct

To ensure a positive environment for all contributors, please adhere to the (TBD) [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). This will help maintain a welcoming and collaborative atmosphere.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you encounter any bugs, your reports would be invaluable. Before submitting a report, please check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/crow50/libraryassembler/issues) to see if it has already been noted.

- **Create a Bug Report**: [Submit a new bug report](https://github.com/crow50/libraryassembler/issues/new?template=issue_template.md) with a clear and descriptive title. Please include as much detail as possible, such as steps to reproduce the issue, expected behavior, and screenshots if applicable.

### Suggesting Features

If you have ideas for new features, Iâ€™d love to hear them! Before suggesting something new, please check the [existing feature requests](https://github.com/crow50/libraryassembler/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22feature+request%22) to see if your idea has already been proposed.

- **Submit a Feature Request**: [Propose a new feature](https://github.com/crow50/libraryassembler/issues/new?template=issue_template.md) with a clear and descriptive title. Provide details on what the feature should do, its benefits, and any potential challenges.

### Contributing Code

I'm excited to accept code contributions! Here's how you can get started:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the project on GitHub and clone your fork locally.
2. **Create a Branch**: Use a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., `feature/metadata-retrieval`, `bugfix/ui-glitch`).
3. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes, following the coding standards outlined below.
4. **Commit Your Changes**: Follow the commit guidelines described in the [Commit Guidelines](#commit-guidelines) section.
5. **Submit a Pull Request**: Push your branch to your fork and open a pull request against the `main` branch of the original repository. Provide a clear and descriptive title and description for your pull request.

### Improving Documentation

Good documentation is crucial, and your help in improving it is greatly appreciated. You can contribute by:

- Enhancing the existing documentation in the `docs/` directory.
- Adding new documentation for features, setup guides, or API references.
- Correcting typos, improving clarity, or providing better examples.

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/crow50/libraryassembler.git
   cd libraryassembler
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Follow the instructions in the `README.md` to install any required dependencies and set up your development environment.

### Branching Strategy

Here's how I manage the branches:

- **`main` branch**: Contains the stable, released code.
- **`dev` branch**: Used for active development. Features and fixes should be merged here first.
- **Feature branches**: Create feature branches from `dev` for new features (`feature/feature-name`).
- **Bugfix branches**: Create bugfix branches from `dev` for fixing bugs (`bugfix/bug-name`).

### Making Changes

- Ensure your code adheres to the existing coding style.
- Add or update tests as necessary.
- Run the tests to make sure nothing is broken.

### Commit Guidelines

- **Commit Messages**: Please write clear and concise commit messages. Start each message with a capitalized verb (e.g., "Fix", "Add", "Update").
- **Multiple Commits**: If your changes are substantial, consider breaking them into smaller, logical commits.

Example commit message:
```
Fix metadata retrieval issue for books without ISBN

- Added fallback mechanism for books missing ISBN
- Updated tests to cover this case
```

### Pull Request Process

- **Describe Your Changes**: Clearly explain what your pull request does and why it's needed.
- **Link to Issues**: If your PR addresses an issue, please link to it in the description.
- **Review Process**: I will review your pull request. There might be some back-and-forth discussion or changes needed before it gets merged.
- **Stay Involved**: Please be ready to respond to any questions or feedback on your pull request.
