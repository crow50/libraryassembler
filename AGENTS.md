# Agent Workflow

- **Shared Workspace**: All agents work in the project root.
- **Directories**:
  - `docs/`: Documentation and written content.
  - `designs/`: Design specs and visual plans.
  - `assets/`: Final creative assets.
  - `src/`: Source code.
- **Mandatory Git**:
  - Commit deliverables (code, designs, docs, assets) directly to the repository.
  - No "mental notes" or local-only files.
  - Commit early and often.
- **Branching**: Use feature branches for new work (`feature/name`).
- **Pull Requests**: Open PRs for review before merging to main.
